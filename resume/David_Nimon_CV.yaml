        highlights:
         - Lead a project to add new features to an existing product offering, working with multiple teams to coordinate the required changes. Presented the changes that our team needed to do, creating tickets and documentation, and implemented major pieces of it, including using GCP services to transcode media, and providing multiple options to test with the 3rd party integrations. Worked with the teams to communicate changes and new needs. Once the code was complemented, I worked with the team on creating runbooks for the deployment, and staging testing documentation.
         - Used multiple opportunities to pair with the team, to work on projects together, provide ideas for implementations, and to share knowledge with the team. I've also supported the staff engineer on our team, pairing with the team and figuring out solutions to issues all together, and helped lead multiple projects.
         - Put together multiple presentations to share with engineers across the company for new features implemented or new uses of our toolset, like open source projects, Google Cloud, and Nomad.
         - Helped diagnose issues that were seen by customers, including building a test player for ads, finding the specific information in logs & databases, and finding a solution to the issues.
         - Migrated CI from Travis to Github Actions, including providing a private library for the company, so other teams and projects using elixir could leverage the same features, for running tests, code quality, and code coverage. As well, implemented a feature to run benchmarks and compare the differences from previous pull requests, and compare the resulting configuration from a pull request to the last release.
         - Created a docker image for local development, so all of the proper dependencies did not have to be installed on the development machine directly.
         - Wrote a new library for kafka dead letter queues in elixir, for a migration from RabbitMQ to Kafka. As well, tested and presented findings for various options for kafka consuming inside elixir. Provided mocks that can be used for testing the new kafka features.
         - Helped review code challenges and participated in interviews for new candidates. Helped mentor multiple new employees.
         - Dealt with on call pages, including diagnostics of the issue, communication with various parties, and brought the system back up. I've also provided support for others on call, including taking notes, taking over communication, or providing possible solutions.
         - Provided documentation on solutions for various tech debt, and helped get the changes to the proper team, or created tickets and implementation where it landed on our team.
         - Functional programming in Elixir, creating pull requests and responding to review requests, and working on various applications and libraries. Ensured that any followup tickets that may be needed, or deployment concerns, were well documented. Added tests for the new code, ensuring that code coverage was handled properly.
         - Worked with GCP instances and terragrunt & terraform, to create and update servers, as well as Chef to update applications and deploy them.
         - Worked with Nomad to migrate applications from GCP instances to Nomad, including auto scaling, configuration migration, and right sizing. Created and maintained Docker images that are used for deployment. Provided examples on how to test on staging vs production. Helped implement public facing applications running inside nomad, behind GCP load balancers.
         - Worked with kafka, rabbitmq, and GCP buckets, to read data, move it to DuckDB for easy querying for diagnostics, and verified applications were working properly.
         - Worked with datadog for dashboards for metrics, including creating new graphs for new features and Nomad migration. Created new monitors for issues that should be alerted, and used notebooks for runbook creation.
         - Helped with building diagrams about the overall system and how the various applications communication with each other. 
         - Worked with team members, including other developers, and UI/UX designers, to design and build new features on the customer facing website. Provided multiple examples on how parts of the new UI would look and feel, so that we could land on a specific implementation.
         - Work on a UI made another project easier, with building it as reusable code.
